# Orks

## Ork Skin
Primer: Wraithbone or similar light cream color
Base: Ork Flesh Contrast Paint
Highlight: Warboss Green

Apply primer as normal. For contrast paint, be on the thicker side with it. You want it to too dark rather than too light. Drybrush Warboss Green on afterwards to make highlights.
